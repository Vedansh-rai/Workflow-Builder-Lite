# 🧠 Prompts Used: Workflow Builder Lite

This document serves as a comprehensive log of the prompts and interactions used to design, build, debug, and deploy the **Workflow Builder Lite** application. It chronicles the journey from initial concept to a production-ready deployment on Render.

## 🚀 Phase 1: Inception & Architecture
**Goal:** Define the core requirements, tech stack, and architectural patterns.

| Date | Prompt / Request | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026-02-11** | *"1️⃣ Step Registry (Extensible Architecture)... 2️⃣ Execution Trace View... 3️⃣ Run History (Persistent Memory)..."* | Defined the core pillars: Registry, Execution, and History. |
| **2026-02-11** | *"Build a Workflow Builder Lite web application..."* | Established the full-stack requirements (React, Node.js, SQLite). |
| **2026-02-11** | *"Create project directory structure..."* | Generated the monorepo structure (`backend` / `frontend`). |

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Core Development
**Goal:** Implement the backend API, frontend UI, and LLM integration.

| Date | Prompt / Request | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026-02-11** | *"Setup Express server and middleware..."* | Created the Node.js/Express backend foundation. |
| **2026-02-11** | *"Setup Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui..."* | Configured the modern UI styling framework. |
| **2026-02-11** | *"Implement Workflow Creation Wizard..."* | Developed the drag-and-drop workflow builder interface. |

## ✨ Phase 3: Feature Enhancements
**Goal:** Refine the application based on user feedback and add specific LLM capabilities.

| Date | Prompt / Request | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026-02-13** | *"Implement 'Translate' and 'Simplify Language' steps; deprecate 'Extract Key Points' and 'Tag Category'."* | **Major Feature Update**: Replaced generic steps with specific "Translate" and "Simplify" actions. |
| **2026-02-13** | *"Start the server to verify backend logic changes."* | Verified backend logic for new step types. |
| **2026-02-13** | *"Initiate end-to-end testing."* | Performed end-to-end testing of the new features. |

## 📝 Phase 4: Documentation & Personalization
**Goal:** Polish the repository for public presentation.

| Date | Prompt / Request | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026-02-13** | *"i have added my resume keep that resume in about.me"* | Integrated user's professional resume into `ABOUTME.md`. |
| **2026-02-13** | *"A short README: how to run... A short AI_NOTES.md... A PROMPTS_USED.md..."* | Created comprehensive documentation suite. |

## ☁️ Phase 5: Deployment & DevOps (The "Render Saga")
**Goal:** Deploy the full-stack application to Render.com and resolve production environment issues.

> **Note:** This phase involved iterative debugging to adapt a local monorepo for a cloud environment.

| Date | Prompt / Request | Implementation / Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026-02-13** | *"Deploy to Render"* | Created `render.yaml` and configured build scripts. |
| **2026-02-13** | *"Error: Cannot find module 'dotenv'"* | **Fix 1:** Updated start command to `cd backend` before running node. |
| **2026-02-13** | *"Error: Cannot find module 'dotenv'" (persisting)* | **Fix 2:** Updated start command to explicitly `npm install` inside backend. |
| **2026-02-13** | *"PathError: Missing parameter name at index 1: *"* | **Fix 3:** Updated Express `app.get('*')` to `app.get(/(.*)/)` for compatibility with newer `path-to-regexp`. |
| **2026-02-13** | *"Error: ENOENT: no such file .../frontend/dist/index.html"* | **Fix 4:** Added `build` script to root `package.json` to ensure frontend acts as part of the build pipeline. |
| **2026-02-13** | *"sh: 1: vite: not found"* | **Fix 5:** Moved `vite` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` and forced `npm install --include=dev` to ensure build tools exist in production. |
| **2026-02-13** | *"Rollup failed to resolve import 'react-router-dom'"* | **Fix 6:** Installed missing runtime dependencies (`react-router-dom`, `lucide-react`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`). |
| **2026-02-13** | *"App not connecting to backend"* | **Fix 7:** Updated `api.js` to use `import.meta.env.PROD` to dynamically switch between localhost and relative `/api` paths. |
